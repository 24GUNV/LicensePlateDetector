## General Information

The project involves training a TensorFlow Lite model to detect license plates and apply bounding boxes to them. The captured images are then processed using Pytesseract to extract the text from the license plates.

## Technologies Used

The License Plate Detector utilizes the following technologies:

- Tensorflow Lite
- Pytesseract

## Features

The License Plate Detector offers the following features:

- Detect and apply bounding box on license plate
- Somewhat get text from image

## Usage

To use the License Plate Detector, follow the steps provided in the notebook for now.

## Project Status

Project is: _in progress_

## Room for Improvement

Areas that could be improved and future development tasks include:

Room for improvement:
- OCR more efficient
- Improve image cleaning for better OCR results

To do:
- Deploy the model on a microcontroller
- Convert notebook to a file format
- Update setup, usage, screenshots section in the README
