## General Information
- I trained a tensorflow lite model to detect and place a bounding box on license plates
- Then applied pytesseract in order to get the text from the image


## Technologies Used
- Tensorflow Lite
- Pytesseract


## Features
- Detect and apply bounding box on license plate
- Somewhat get text from image

## Setup
Use the same steps as the notebook (for now)


<!-- ## Usage -->


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_


## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:
- OCR more efficient
- Cleaning of the image be better for the OCR

To do:
- Get deployment on microcontroller
- Convert notebook to file format
- Update setup, usage, screenshot section to README
